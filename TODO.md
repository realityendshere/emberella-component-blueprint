TODOS
==========================================

* Publish to NPM/Bower
* Add scripts/tasks for automating releases
* Build tooling for starting a new project with the blueprint (Like Ember CLI for modules)
* Build tooling for upgrading the blueprint features of an existing project
* JSHint support
* Strip console/debugger/Ember.assert (defeaturify)
* Output code comments to documentation (YUI Doc)
* Figure out a good way to alter project details in package.json and bower.json
